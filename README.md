### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Omkar Sawant, a final year student pusruing my Bachelors in Computer Engineering.  [[Resume]](https://github.com/OmkarDSawant/Certificates/blob/main/Omkar's%20Resume.pdf "My Resume")

I enjoy building products and am enthusiastic about learning new technologies. As a result I have learnt and built projects on handful of languages.

I have built softwares using: <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Javascript - NodeJS [[Project]](https://github.com/OmkarDSawant/expenseTrackerSystem "Expense Tracker System") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Java - Spring Boot [[Project]](https://github.com/OmkarDSawant/MobileCrudApp "Mobile Crud App") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Dart - Flutter <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Python - Django
    
This does make me *JACK OF ALL TRADES! :wink:* The real intention was to explore different languages and understand their design pattern. But I ended up learning much more; prominent among all was the ability to switch between languages.

I use C++ to solve Competitive Programming Problems! [You can check out my codes here.](https://github.com/OmkarDSawant/CPP "By Omkar Sawant")

I am curious about web 3.0 and also optimistic about where it is headed.

If you have a few more minutes to spare I would like to share few pieces of information that might add some value to you: <br><br>
